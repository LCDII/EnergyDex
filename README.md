This is a Kotlin Multiplatform project targeting Android, iOS, and WebAssembly, with a shared server core.

* [/app/shared](./app/shared/src) is for code shared across the Compose Multiplatform applications.
  It contains several subfolders:
  - [commonMain](./app/shared/src/commonMain/kotlin) is for code that’s common for all client targets.
  - Other folders are for Kotlin code that will be compiled for only the platform indicated in the folder name.
    For example, if you want to use Apple’s CoreCrypto for the iOS part of your Kotlin app,
    the [iosMain](./app/shared/src/iosMain/kotlin) folder would be the right place for such calls.

* [/core](./core/src/commonMain/kotlin) contains models and validation shared by client and server.

* [/server](./server) contains the Ktor server application and depends on `core`.

* [/app/androidApp](./app/androidApp) contains the Android application entry point.

* [/app/webApp](./app/webApp) contains the WebAssembly application entry point.

* [/app/iosApp](./app/iosApp/iosApp) contains iOS applications. Even if you’re sharing your UI with Compose Multiplatform,
  you need this entry point for your iOS app. This is also where you should add SwiftUI code for your project.

### Build and Run Android Application

To build and run the development version of the Android app, use the run configuration from the run widget

  ```
- on Windows
  ```shell
  .\gradlew.bat :app:androidApp:assembleDebug

### Run the Server

```shell
./gradlew :server:run
```
  ```

### Build and Run iOS Application

To build and run the development version of the iOS app, use the run configuration from the run widget
in your IDE’s toolbar or open the [/app/iosApp](./app/iosApp) directory in Xcode and run it from there.
